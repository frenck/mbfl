Notes for revision 2.0d1
------------------------

* BACKWARDS  INCOMPATIBILITY The  preprocessor macros  are now  prefixed
  with "mbfl_".

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY  The getopts  module raises  an error  if an
  option with argument is used with an empty value.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined   command  line   option
  "--print-action-arguments" does not exist anymore.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined  command   line  options
  "--license", "--version", etc. do not  exit immediately in the getopts
  module;  rather they  register a  function to  be called  by the  main
  module.  So  the selected "after  parsing options" function  is called
  before exiting.

* BACKWARDS      INCOMPATIBILITY       The      deprecated      function
  "mbfl_program_check()" has been removed.

* The global variables: ARGC1, ARGV1,  ARGC, ARGV are no more read-only;
  ugly, but it allows test suites to use them.
