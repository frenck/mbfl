	       Changes to Marco's Bash Functions Library
	       =========================================


Notes for revision 2.3.0-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Package building and installing infrastructure review.

* Added string functions:

    mbfl_string_is_empty
    mbfl_string_is_not_empty
    mbfl_string_length
    mbfl_string_length_equal_to

* Added times and dates module.


Notes for revision 2.2.0
------------------------

* Added file functions to change owner and group.


Notes for revision 2.1b0
------------------------

* This is meant to be a beta release.

* The program module now uses numeric file descriptors: when a script is
  run  from  a  Cron  job,  it appears  no  aliases  are  available  (no
  /dev/stdin, /dev/fd/0, et cetera).


Notes for revision 2.1d0
------------------------

* Added functions:

     mbfl_string_is_extended_identifier
     mbfl_string_is_extended_identifier_char

* Rewritten support for running programs through sudo.

* For  sendmail-mbfl:  renamed  files  ".hostinfo"  and  ".authinfo"  to
  ".mbfl-hostinfo" and ".mbfl-authinfo".


Notes for revision 2.0b0
------------------------

* Fixed  "mbfl_string_is_*"  functions  to  accept an  empty  string  as
  argument and return with error status.

* Added function "mbfl_program_replace".


Notes for revision 2.0d1
------------------------

* BACKWARDS  INCOMPATIBILITY The  preprocessor macros  are now  prefixed
  with "mbfl_".

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY  The getopts  module raises  an error  if an
  option with argument is used with an empty value.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined   command  line   option
  "--print-action-arguments" does not exist anymore.

* BACKWARDS   INCOMPATIBILITY  The   predefined  command   line  options
  "--license", "--version", etc. do not  exit immediately in the getopts
  module;  rather they  register a  function to  be called  by the  main
  module.  So  the selected "after  parsing options" function  is called
  before exiting.

* BACKWARDS      INCOMPATIBILITY       The      deprecated      function
  "mbfl_program_check()" has been removed.

* The global variables: ARGC1, ARGV1,  ARGC, ARGV are no more read-only;
  ugly, but it allows test suites to use them.

* Added module "actions" implementing a tree of script actions.

* Started interface to "stat" from GNU Coreutils.
