1. Introduction
---------------

The  MBFL is a  collection of  shell functions.  I've tested
them only  with the  GNU BASH shell,  so I do  not guarantee
that they can work with other shells.

3. Install
----------

Read the INSTALL file.


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo format. Briefely: the best
way to use the library  is to include at runtime the library
file  "libmbfl.sh"  in  the  script;  this  is  possible  by
installing MBFL  on the  system and using  this code  in the
scripts:

  source "${MBFL_LIBRARY:=`mbfl-config`}"

the output of the  "mbfl-config" script is the full pathname
of the library file. The value can be overridden setting the
environment variable "MBFL_LIBRARY".


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.


B. Bugs
-------

Bug reports  are appreciated: send them to  me by electronic
mail.   Take   the  mail  hostname  of  my   ISP,  which  is
"tiscalinet.it", and join it with my mail username, which is
"marcomaggi".
