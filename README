1. Introduction
---------------

The  MBFL is a  collection of  shell functions.  I've tested
them only  with the  GNU BASH shell,  so I do  not guarantee
that they can work with other shells.

3. Install
----------

Read the INSTALL file.


4. Usage
--------

Each library file is self-documenting: read the source.

  Usually  I  install  the   libraries  on  a  "well  known"
directory, then  I just include  them in the  script source.
The GNU m4 preprocessor is a  good tool to do that: I put in
the source script some macro invocation like the following:

     m4_include(libmbfl.sh)

and  preprocess  the  script  with  a  make  rule  like  the
following:

     M4PROG	= m4
     M4FLAGS	= --prefix-builtins --include=$(LIBSHDIR)

     LIBSHDIR	= ...

     %.sh: %.sh.m4
		$(M4PROG) $(M4FLAGS) $(<) >$(@)

obviously I  use GNU Autoconf to  preprocess the "Makefile",
so  I  search the  library  directory  from the  "configure"
script.


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.


B. Bugs
-------

Bug reports  are appreciated: send them to  me by electronic
mail.   Take   the  mail  hostname  of  my   ISP,  which  is
"tiscalinet.it", and join it with my mail username, which is
"marcomaggi".
