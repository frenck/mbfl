1. Introduction
---------------

The MBFL is a collection of shell functions for the GNU Bash
shell.  This  package is  an attempt to  make Bash  a viable
solution for medium sized scripts.

3. Install
----------

See  the "README.build"  file  for the  requirements of  the
building infrastructure.  Do this:

    $ cd mbfl-1.3b1
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ cd "=build"

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make tests
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/mbfl

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/mbfl

  The "make  tests" invocation will run all  the tests under
the "$(srcdir)/tests"  directory.  To select a  set of tests
set the  "TESTMATCH" variable to  a string that  matches the
test names (the  names of the functions in  the test files);
for example, the following runs the getopts tests:

    $ make tests TESTMATCH=getopts

and the following runs only the "getopts-2.4" test:

    $ make tests TESTMATCH=getopts-2.4


4. Usage
--------

Read  the documentation  in Texinfo  format.   Briefely: the
best way  to use  the library is  to include at  runtime the
library file "libmbfl.sh" in the script; this is possible by
installing MBFL  on the  system and using  this code  in the
scripts:

  source "${MBFL_LIBRARY:=$(mbfl-config)}"

the output of the  "mbfl-config" script is the full pathname
of the  library file.  The  value can be  overridden setting
the environment variable "MBFL_LIBRARY".


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.


B. Bugs
-------

reporting interface at the GNA! site.
