1. Introduction
---------------

The  MBFL is a  collection of  shell functions.  I've tested
them only  with the  GNU BASH shell,  so I do  not guarantee
that they can work with other shells.

3. Install
----------

Read the INSTALL file. One should do:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo format. Briefely: the best
way to use the library  is to include at runtime the library
file  "libmbfl.sh"  in  the  script;  this  is  possible  by
installing MBFL  on the  system and using  this code  in the
scripts:

  source "${MBFL_LIBRARY:=$(mbfl-config)}"

the output of the  "mbfl-config" script is the full pathname
of the library file. The value can be overridden setting the
environment variable "MBFL_LIBRARY".


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.


B. Bugs

reporting interface at the GNA! site.
