1. Introduction
---------------

The MBFL  is a  collection of  shell functions  for the  GNU Bash
shell.  This package is an attempt to make Bash a viable solution
for medium sized scripts.

3. Install
----------

This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.  Do this:

    $ cd mbfl-1.3.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

then do it:

    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  Makefile  supports  the DESTDIR  environment  variable  to
install files in a temporary  location, example: to see what will
happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/mbfl

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/mbfl

  Notice that,  when running  "make check",  we can  select which
test to run by redefining the "TESTS" variable; for example:

    $ make check TESTS=program.test

will run only the "program.test" file.

  After building  the package, and  before installing it,  we can
test the example scripts as follows:

    $ make test-template MFLAGS='--help'

will run "examples/template.sh" with the flags "--help";

    $ make test-template-actions MFLAGS='one green gas --help'

will run "examples/template-actions.sh" with the flags "--help".


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo  format.  Briefly: the best way
to use  the library  is to  include at  runtime the  library file
"libmbfl.sh" in the  script; this is possible  by installing MBFL
on the system and using this code in the scripts:

  source "${MBFL_LIBRARY:=$(mbfl-config)}"

the output  of the "mbfl-config"  script is the full  pathname of
the  library  file.  The  value  can  be overridden  setting  the
environment variable "MBFL_LIBRARY".


A. Credits
----------

The stuff  was written  by Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists
it's because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the
time.


B. Bugs
-------

the Github site.
