* General

** Change the values of the  boolean script options from "yes" and "no"
   to "true" and "false", that way we can test them with:

   if $script_option_STUFF
   then do_something
   fi

   or even:

   $script_option_STUFF && do_something

   this is a change  in the interface, so it should be  done with a bump
   in the major version number: do it for 2.0?

* Testing

  More tests for signal handling.

* Sendmail

  Understand if the  gsasl executable installed by GNU SASL  can be used
  to implement the other authentication mechanism.
