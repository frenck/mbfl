@chapter Overview of the package


This package is an attempt to make @gnu{} Bash a viable solution for
medium sized scripts.  A set of modules implementing common operations
and a script template are offered by this package and the author has
used them with success in implementing non--small scripts.

The philosophy of @mbfl{} is to do the work as much as possible without
external commands.  For example: string manipulation is done using the
special variable substitution provided by Bash, and no use is done of
utilities like @command{sed}, @command{grep} and @command{ed}.

The library is better used starting from the template script
@file{examples/template.sh}.  This is because with @mbfl{} some choices
have been made to reduce the application dependent part of the script to
the smallest dimension; if we follow another schema, @mbfl{} modules may
be inadequate.  This is especially true for the options parsing module.

@section Quick run time loading


The easiest way to use the library is to include at run time the library
file @file{libmbfl.sh} in the script.  To do it, we install the package
on the system and use this code in the scripts:

@example
source "$@{MBFL_LIBRARY:=$(mbfl-config)@}"
@end example

@noindent
after the service variables have been declared.  @ref{service variables,
Required user defined variables}.

This code will read the full pathname of the library from the
environment variable @env{MBFL_LIBRARY}; if this variable is not set:
the script @command{mbfl-config} is invoked with no arguments to acquire
the pathname.  @command{mbfl-config} is installed by the package in the
@code{$(bindir)} directory, which we must include in the @env{PATH}
environment variable.

@c page
@node overview reliable
@section Reliable run time loading


A more reliable way to load the library is:

@smallexample
mbfl_INTERACTIVE=no
mbfl_LOADED=no
mbfl_INSTALLED=$(mbfl-config) &>/dev/null
mbfl_HARDCODED=./some/dir/libmbfl.sh
for item in \
    "$MBFL_LIBRARY" "$mbfl_HARDCODED" "$mbfl_INSTALLED"
do
    test -n "$item" -a -f "$item" -a -r "$item" && @{
        source "$item" &>/dev/null || @{
            printf '%s error: loading MBFL file "%s"\n' \
                "$script_PROGNAME" "$item" >&2
            exit 2
        @}
    @}
done
unset -v item
test "$mbfl_LOADED" = yes || @{
    printf '%s error: incorrect evaluation of MBFL\n' \
        "$script_PROGNAME" >&2
    exit 2
@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
where the optional @file{./some/dir/libmbfl.sh} can be the pathname of a
known location in which to find the library.  This code:

@enumerate
@item
Looks for the pathname in the @env{MBFL_LIBRARY} variable, to allow us
to explicitly select the file from the command line; example:

@example
$ MBFL_LIBRARY=/path/to/libmbfl.sh script.sh
@end example

@item
Looks in some known directory; for example a subdirectory of a software
package that we have distributed.

@item
As a last resort tries to evaluate the @command{mbfl-config} script to
pick up a library installed on the system.
@end enumerate

We see that the output of the @command{source} command is discarded:
this is because we assume that:

@itemize
@item
If an error occurs evaluating the library a lot of error messages may
fill the screen, confusing the user; we just want a single error message
pointing the finger of blame.

@item
An error in the evaluation of the library code can be replicated because
the evaluation does not heavily depend on the environment, so we can
track down library errors later.
@end itemize

This code is included in the @mbfl{} distribution in the
@file{src/lib/loader.sh} file.

@c page
@node overview direct
@section Direct inclusion


Another solution is to directly include the library in the script; this
is easy if we preprocess our scripts with @gnu{} M4.  We only need to
put the following in the script:

@example
m4_changequote([[,]])
m4_include(libmbfl.sh)
@end example

@noindent
then preprocess the script with:

@example
$ m4 --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library \
         script.sh.m4 >script.sh
@end example

@noindent
easy to do in a @file{Makefile}.  The installation directory pathname of
the library (@file{/path/to/library} in the example) is the output of
@code{mbfl-config --libpath}.

It is also interesting to process the script with the following rule of
@gnu{} Make: assuming that the source scripts are in the
@file{src/modules} directory of the source tree:

@example
vpath	%.sh.m4		$(srcdir)/src/modules

M4      = ...
M4FLAGS = --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library

%.sh: %.sh.m4
        $(M4) $(M4FLAGS) $(<) | \
        grep --invert-match -e '^#' -e '^$$' | \
        sed -e "s/^ \\+//" >$(@@)
@end example

@noindent
this will remove all the comments and blank lines, decreasing the size
of the script significantly if one makes use of verbose comments; note
that this will wipe out the @code{#!/bin/bash} first line, too.

Usually we want the script to begin with @code{#!/bin/bash} followed by
a comment describing the license terms.  We can do it by preparing a
script like the following:

@example
#!/bin/bash
# ... license ...

m4_include(realscript.sh)

### end of file
@end example

@noindent
and processing it with the following make rule:

@example
M4      = ...
M4FLAGS = --prefix-builtins --include=/path/to/library

script.sh: script.sh.m4 realscript.sh
        $(M4) $(M4FLAGS) $(<) >$(@@)
@end example

@noindent
@file{realscript.sh} can be processed as explained above.

At this point, though, it is better to use the @mbfl{} preprocessor.
@ref{preprocessor, Using the script preprocessor}.

@c page
@node overview notes
@section Notes


@itemize
@item
Some functions take a variable name as argument and store in the
referenced variable some value; to avoid name collision: select a name
that starts with @code{p_}.  It is guaranteed that @mbfl{} never uses
variables with name starting with such a prefix.

@item
It is possible, but not recommended, to source the library in an
interactive shell, though some modules must be disabled.  The purpose of
interactive loading is only to test and debug the functions by hand.

To do this execute the following code in the shell before sourcing the
library:

@example
mbfl_INTERACTIVE=yes
@end example

@noindent
without exporting the variable.  The ``dangerous'' blocks of code in the
library are surrounded by:

@example
test "$mbfl_INTERACTIVE" = yes || @{
    ...
@}
@end example

@noindent
so they are not executed.  Disabled modules are: main, getopts, signal;
``disabled'' does not mean that the functions are not there: only the
global variable declarations are excluded; this is a little dirty, but,
at present, it should work.

@item
The @code{read} built in does word splitting on the text it reads, even
when there is a single output variable.  We can verify it with:

@example
printf '\tciao\n' | @{
    read line
    echo line was "'$line'"
@}
@print{} line was 'ciao'
@end example

@noindent
we see that the initial tabulation character has been stripped, because
it is a character in the deafult value of @code{IFS}.  Word splitting
does not happen when we set @code{IFS} to the empty string:

@example
printf '\tciao\n' | @{
    IFS= read line
    echo line was "'$line'"
@}
@print{} line was '        ciao'
@end example

To avoid the mutation of text read with @code{read}, @mbfl{} always sets
@code{IFS} to the empty string in the environment in which @code{read}
is evalulated.  This happens in functions like
@bfunc{mbfl_read_maybe_null} and @bfunc{mbfl_dialog_ask_password};
notice, though, that these functions @strong{do not} mutate the
@code{IFS} value in the environment of the caller.
@end itemize


@c page
@node preprocessor
@chapter Using the script preprocessor


The @mbfl{} script preprocessor is a command line program named
@command{mbflpp.sh}; it is itself a Bash script that makes use of the
@mbfl{} library.  It can remove comments, blank lines, blank characters
at the beginning of lines, and it can expand macros.

The macro preprocessing is done with the @gnu{} m4 program, using a
library of macros called @file{preprocessor.m4} which is installed on
the system with the @mbfl{} package.

The use of the preprocessor is fully optional: every feature of the
@mbfl{} library can be used without the preprocessor.

@section Invoking the preprocessor


The basic synopsis is:

@smallexample
mbflpp.sh [options] <INFILE >OUTFILE
mbflpp.sh [options] --outfile=OUTFILE [--] INFILE1 INFILE2 ...
@end smallexample

@noindent
all the @code{INFILE} pathnames are interpreted as files to concatenate
in the specified order.

All the @mbfl{} built in command line options are available,
additionally the following options are supported.

@table @code
@item --preserve-comments
Do not filter out comments.

@item --add-bash
Add @code{#!/usr/local/bin/bash} at the beginning of the output.

@item --define=VALUE
Define a new symbols (M4 syntax).  This is equivalent to the
@option{--define} option of M4.

@item --include=VALUE
Add a search path for files.  @code{VALUE} must be a directory pathname
and it is handed to M4 to search for macro files.  Can be used multiple
times.

@item --library=VALUE
Include an M4 library.  @code{VALUE} must be the name of an M4 macro
file which is evaluated before the input files.

@item -oVALUE
@itemx --output=VALUE
Select an output file, @code{-} for stdout.

@item -e
@itemx --eval
If used evaluates the output script in bash, instead of printing it.
@end table

@c page
@node preprocessor macros
@section Macros library


The M4 preprocessor is invoked by @command{mbflpp.sh} with the
@option{--prefix-builtins} option; so all the M4 built in macros and
directives are available prefixed with @code{m4_}.


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} mandatory_parameter @var{varname} @var{number} @var{name}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the
function.  @var{varname} is the name of the variable; @var{number} is
the positional parameter number; @var{name} is a description of the
argument.

Example, the following:

@example
mandatory_parameter(PATHNAME, 2, file pathname)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
local PATHNAME=$@{2:?"missing file pathname parameter to '$@{FUNCNAME@}'"@}
@end smallexample

Another example the following function:

@example
function message () @{
  mandatory_parameter(PROGNAME, 1, program name)
  mandatory_parameter(STRING,   2, message string)

  printf '%s: %s\n' "$@{PROGNAME@}" "$@{STRING@}"
@}
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
function message () @{
  local PROGNAME=$@{1:?"missing program name parameter to '$@{FUNCNAME@}'"@}
  local STRING=$@{2:?"missing message string parameter to '$@{FUNCNAME@}'"@}

  printf '%s: %s\n' "$@{PROGNAME@}" "$@{STRING@}"
@}
@end smallexample

@noindent
and so it is a function with two mandatory parameters.
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} optional_parameter @var{varname} @var{number} @var{default_value}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the
function.  @var{varname} is the name of the variable; @var{number} is
the positional parameter number; @var{default_value} is the
initialisation value for the variable if the argument is not used.

Example, the following:

@example
optional_parameter(COUNT, 2, 123)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@smallexample
local count=$@{2:-123@}"
@end smallexample
@end deffn


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} command_line_argument @var{varname} @var{argindex}
Define a variable local to a shell function holding an argument to the
script.  @var{varname} is the variable name, @var{argindex} is the
argument index in the @code{ARGV} array.

Example, the following:

@example
command_line_argument(PATHNAME,3)
@end example

@noindent
is expanded to:

@example
local PATHNAME="$@{ARGV[3]@}"
@end example
@end deffn

@node service variables
@chapter Required user defined variables


The following variables are expected to be defined before the @mbfl{}
code is evaluated.  They are used by @mbfl{} to compute values for its
own variables.


@defvar script_PROGNAME
The name of the script.
@end defvar

@defvar script_AUTHOR
The name of the script author(s).
@end defvar

@defvar script_COPYRIGHT_YEARS
A comma separated list of years of copyright.
@end defvar

@defvar script_VERSION
The version number of the script.
@end defvar

@defvar script_LICENSE
The identifier of the license under which the script is released.
Accepted values are: @code{GPL} or @code{GPL2}, @code{GPL3}, @code{LGPL}
or @code{LGPL2}, @code{LGPL3}, @code{BSD}.  It is used to select the
appropriate value to be displayed when the user of the script selects
the @code{--license} option.  @ref{getopts options, Predefined options}
@end defvar

@defvar script_USAGE
Must be a string describing the usage of the program.
@end defvar

@defvar script_DESCRIPTION
One line string providing a brief description of the program.  It is used
in the help screen (the one echoed when the @option{--help} option is
used) just after the content of @code{script_USAGE}.
@end defvar

@defvar script_EXAMPLES
One or more lines of text to be displayed at the end of the help screen,
after the options description.  It should contain examples of common
invocations for the script.

The string is used as first argument to @bfunc{printf}, so escape
sequences like @code{\t} and @code{\n} are expanded.
@end defvar

All the text in these variables is used as argument to the @code{printf}
built--in command; in particular: @code{script_DESCRIPTION} and
@code{script_EXAMPLES} are used as first argument to @code{printf}, so
the escape sequences are evaluated.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Examples

The following example shows how to declare the variables.

@example
script_PROGNAME=myscript.sh
script_AUTHOR='Marco Maggi and Marco Maggi'
script_COPYRIGHT_YEARS='2002, 2003, 2004'
script_VERSION=1.0
script_LICENSE=GPL3
script_USAGE="usage: $script_PROGNAME [options] ..."
script_DESCRIPTION='Does this and that.'
script_EXAMPLES='Examples:

\tmyscript.sh --do-something arg arg ...
\tmyscript.sh --do-other arg arg ...'
@end example

Notice that @code{script_DESCRIPTION} and @code{script_EXAMPLES}
@strong{do not} end with a newline character.

character is used as terminator, like in:

@example
IFS= read -d $'\x00'

@node encoding
@chapter Encoding and decoding strings


The purpose of this module is to let an external process invoke a Bash
script with @emph{damned} command line arguments: strings including
blanks or strange characters that may trigger quoting rules.

This problem can arise when using scripting languages with some sort of
@code{eval} command.

The solution is to encode the argument string in hexadecimal or octal
format strings, so that all the damned characters are converted to
``good'' ones.  The the Bash script can convert them back.


@defun mbfl_decode_hex @var{string}
Decodes a hex string and outputs it on stdout.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_decode_oct @var{string}
Decodes a oct string and outputs it on stdout.
@end defun


Example:

@example
mbfl_decode_hex 414243
-> ABC
@end example

@subsection Splitting a file name into its components



@defun mbfl_file_extension @var{pathname}
Extract the extension from a file name.  Search the last dot character
in the argument string and echo to stdout the range of characters from
the dot to the end, not including the dot.  If a slash character or the
beginning of the string is found first: echoes to stdout the empty
string.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_dirname @var{pathname}
Extract the directory part from a fully qualified file name.  Search the
last slash character in the input string and echo to stdout the range of
characters from the first to the slash, not including the slash.

If no slash is found: echo a single dot (the current directory).

If the input string begins with @code{/} or @code{//} with no slash
characters after the first ones: echo a single slash.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_rootname @var{pathname}
Extract the root portion of a file name.  Search the last dot character
in the argument string and echo to stdout the range of characters from
the beginning to the dot, not including the dot.

If a slash character is found first, or no dot is found, or the dot is
the first character: echo the empty string.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_tail @var{pathname}
Extract the file portion from a fully qualified file name.  Search the
last slash character in the input string and echo to stdout the range of
characters from the slash to the end, not including the slash.  If no
slash is found: echo the whole string.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_split @var{pathname}
Separate a file name into its components.  One or more contiguous
occurrences of the slash character is used as separator.  The components
are stored in an array named @code{SPLITPATH}, that may be declared
@code{local} in the scope of the caller; the base index is zero.  The
number of elements in the array is stored in a variable named
@code{SPLITCOUNT}.  Return true.

@code{..}.

If @var{pathname} is relative (according to
@bfunc{mbfl_file_is_absolute}) and @var{prefix} is not present or it
is the empty string: the current process working directory is prepended
to @var{pathname}.

If @var{prefix} is present and non empty, and @var{pathname} is relative
(according to @bfunc{mbfl_file_is_absolute}): @var{prefix} is
prepended to @var{pathname} and normalised, too.

Echo to stdout the normalised file name.  Return true.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_subpathname @var{pathname} @var{basedir}
If @var{pathname} is a subdirectory or file under @var{basedir}: print
to stdout the subpathname portion.  Example:

@example
mbfl_file_subpathname /a/b/c /a
-> ./b/c
@end example

Both @var{pathname} and @var{basedir} must be full (normalised)
pathnames for this function to work.

If @var{pathname} is recognised  as subpathname of @var{basedir}: the
return code is zero; else the return code is one.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_is_absolute @var{pathname}
Return true if the first character in @var{pathname} is a slash
(@code{/}); else returns false.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_is_absolute_dirname @var{pathname}

If @var{PATHNAME} argument is not used: it defaults to the current value
of @code{mbfl_option_TMPDIR}.

@item
If @var{PATHNAME} is not null and it is a directory and it is writable:
it is accepted as value.

@item
If @var{PATHNAME} argument is invalid: the value @file{/tmp/$USER},

@node file read and write
@section Reading and writing files with privileges


The following functions perform actions that can normally be done
directly with the redirection operators of Bash:

@example
# write to a file
printf '%s' "$string" >"$filename"

# append to a file
printf '%s' "$string" >>"$filename"

# read a file, print contents
printf '%s' "$(<$filename)"
@end example

The functions act differently in that they spawn a @command{bash}
subprocess, by invoking @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}, and let it do the
operation; this allows us to request the usage of @command{sudo} and so
to read and write files with modified privileges, but only for the time
needed to do the operation, not for the whole script.


@defun mbfl_file_write @var{string} @var{filename}
Write @var{string} to @var{filename}, eventually creating it or
overwriting old contents.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_file_append @var{string} @var{filename}
Append @var{string} to @var{filename}, eventually creating it.

@chapter Parsing command line options


The getopt module defines a set of procedures to be used to process
command line arguments with the following format:

@table @code
@item -a
Brief option @code{a} with no value.

@item -a123
Brief option @code{a} with value @code{123}.

@item --bianco
Long option @code{bianco} with no value.

@item --color=bianco
Long option @code{color} with value @code{bianco}.
@end table

@menu
* getopts arguments::           Arguments.
* getopts usage::               Using the module.
* getopts options::             Predefined options.
* getopts interface::           Interface functions.
@end menu

@c page
@node getopts arguments
@section Arguments


The module contains, at the root level, a block of code like the
following:

@example
ARGC=0
declare -a ARGV ARGV1

for ((ARGC1=0; $# > 0; ++ARGC1))
do
    ARGV1[$ARGC1]=$1
    shift
done
@end example

@noindent
this block is executed when @mbfl{} (and the script that loads it) is
evaluated.  Its purpose is to store command line arguments in the global
array @code{ARGV1} and the number of command line arguments in the
global variable @code{ARGC1}.

The global array @code{ARGV} and the global variable @code{ARGC} are
predefined and should be used by the @code{mbfl_getopts_*} functions to
store non--option command line arguments.

Example:

@example
$ script --gulp wo --gasp=123 wa
@end example

@noindent
if the script makes use of @mbfl{}, the strings @code{wo} and @code{wa}
will go into @code{ARGV} and @code{ARGC} will be set to 2.  The option
arguments are processed and some action is performed to register them.

We can access the non--option arguments with the following code:

@example
for ((i=0; $i < $ARGC; ++i))
do
    # do something with $@{ARGV[$i]@}
done
@end example

When using action arguments: the first non--option argument can be
interpreted as special value that selects an action to be performed by
the script.  In this case the first argument is removed from the
@code{ARGV} array, so that processing the other arguments is not
affected.

@c page
@node getopts usage
@section Using the module


To use this module we have to declare a set of script options and
optionally a set of action arguments.  We declare a new script option
with the function @bfunc{mbfl_declare_option} and a new action argument
with the function @bfunc{mbfl_declare_action_argument}.

Option and action argument declarations should be done at the beginning
of the script, before doing anything else; for example: right after the
@mbfl{} library code.

In the main block of the script, options are parsed by invoking
@bfunc{mbfl_getopts_parse}: this function will update global variables
and invoke a script function for each option on the command line.  It
can also select a function to be invoked as the main action of the
script.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Option with no argument

Example of option declaration:

@example
mbfl_declare_option ALPHA no a alpha noarg "enable alpha option"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares an option with no argument having properties:

@itemize
@item
Global variable @code{script_option_ALPHA}, which will be set to
@code{no} by default and to @code{yes} if the option is used.

@item
Brief switch @option{-a}.

@item
Long switch @option{--alpha}.

@item
Description @code{enable alpha option}, to be shown in the usage help
screen.
@end itemize

If the option is used: the function @code{script_option_update_alpha} is
invoked (if it exists) with no arguments, after the variable
@code{script_option_ALPHA} has been set to @code{yes}.  Valid option
uses are:

@example
$ script.sh -a
$ script.sh --alpha
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Option with argument

Example of option declaration:

@example
mbfl_declare_option BETA 123 b beta witharg "select beta value"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares an option with argument having properties:

@itemize
@item
Global variable @code{script_option_BETA}, which will be set to
@code{123} by default and to the value selected on the command line if
the option is used.

@item
Brief switch @option{-b}.

@item
Long switch @option{--beta}.

@item
Description @code{select beta value}, to be shown in the usage output.
@end itemize

If the option is used: the function @code{script_option_update_beta} is
invoked (if it exists) with no arguments, after the variable
@code{script_option_BETA} has been set to the selected value.  Valid
option uses are:

@example
$ script.sh -b456
$ script.sh --beta=456
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Action options

A special option example:

@example
mbfl_declare_option ACTION_GAMMA \
   no g gamma noarg "do gamma action"
mbfl_declare_option ACTION_DELTA \
   yes d delta noarg "do delta action"
@end example

@noindent
this code declares two options with no arguments; the difference from
the other declarations is that the keywords are prefixed with
@code{ACTION_}: this prefix is recognised by the module and causes, if
the option is used on the command line, the following code to be
evaluated at argument parsing time:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_gamma
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_delta
@end example

@noindent
where the argument @code{script_action_gamma} is built by prefixing the
lower case version of the keyword with @code{script_}.  The code selects
a function as main function for the script.  @ref{main function, Driving
script execution}.

Additionally, if the default value is @code{yes}: the main function is
selected at declaration time (that is by @bfunc{mbfl_declare_option});
this is useful to declare an action option and select automatically the
action function.  In the example: the function
@bfunc{script_action_delta} is selected as main action function.

It is an error to declare a keyword prefixed with @code{ACTION_} with an
option with argument.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Action arguments

The following example declares two action arguments:

@example
mbfl_declare_action_argument gamma gamma no  no "do gamma action"
mbfl_declare_action_argument delta delta yes no "do delta action"
@end example

@noindent
an action argument is a non--option argument that is used on the command
line as first parameter; its purpose is to select a function to be
evaluated as main action of the script.

The first of the two declarations has the following properties:

@itemize
@item
Action argument keyword @code{gamma} (the first one); this is the
internal identifier of the argument used to build the associated action
function name.

@item
Argument string on the command line @code{gamma} (the second one).

@item
Selection value set to @code{no} (the first one): this script action is
not selected by default.

@item
Options parsing activated when this action argument is found as first
argument for the script (the second @code{no}).

@item
Description @code{do gamma action}, to be shown in the usage output.
@end itemize

If the first parameter to the script is @code{gamma} or @code{delta},
the following code is evaluated at argument parsing time:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_gamma
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
mbfl_main_set_main script_action_delta
@end example

@noindent
where the argument @code{script_action_gamma} is built by prefixing the
the keyword with @code{script_action_}.  The code selects a function as
main function for the script.  @ref{main function, Driving script
execution}.

Additionally, if the selection value is @code{yes}: the main function is
selected at declaration time (that is by
@bfunc{mbfl_declare_action_argument}); this is useful to declare an
action option and select automatically the action function.  In the
example: the function @bfunc{script_action_delta} is selected as main
action function.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Action arguments and action options

Notice that action arguments and action options implement the same
feature and are fully compatible with each other.  Both can be used to
select an action for the script.

When declaring action options and action arguments selected by default:
the last one wins.  So the following:

@example
mbfl_declare_option ACTION_GAMMA \
  yes g gamma noarg "do gamma action"

mbfl_declare_action_argument delta \
  delta yes no "do delta action"
@end example

@noindent
defines a @code{--gamma} action option and a @code{delta} action
argument, and the main function is set to @bfunc{script_action_delta}.

However, it is bad interface design to use both of them; it is better to
use action arguments @strong{or} action options.

@c page
@node getopts options
@section Predefined options


A set of predefined options is recognised by the library and not handed
to the user defined functions.

@table @option
@item --tmpdir=DIR
Selects a directory for temporary files.  The default value is the one in
the environment variable @env{TMPDIR}, or @file{/tmp/$USER} if that
variable is not set.  The value is stored in the variable
@code{mbfl_option_TMPDIR}.

@item --encoded-args
Signals to the library that the non--option arguments and the option
values are encoded in hexadecimal strings.  Encoding is useful to avoid
quoting problems when invoking a script from another one.

If this option is used: the values are decoded by
@bfunc{mbfl_getopts_parse} before storing them in the @code{ARGV}
array and before being stored in the option's specific global variables.

@item -v
@itemx --verbose
Turns on verbose messages.  If this option is used: The function
@bfunc{mbfl_option_verbose} returns true.  @ref{message, Printing
messages to the console}.

@item --silent
Turns off verbose messages.  If this option is used: The function
@bfunc{mbfl_option_verbose} returns false.

@item --verbose-program
If used: The @option{--verbose} option is added to the command line of
external programs that support it.  The function
@bfunc{mbfl_option_verbose_program} returns true or false depending on
the state of this option.

@item --show-program
Prints the command line of executed external programs.

@item --debug
Turns on debugging messages.  Automatically turns on verbose messages
and program showing.  @ref{message, Printing messages to the console}.

@item --test
Turns on test execution.  @ref{program testing, Testing a script and
external programs}.

@item --null
Signals to the script that it has to use the null character to separate
values, instead of the common newline.  The global variable
@code{mbfl_option_NULL} is set to @code{yes}.

@item -f
@itemx --force
Signals to the script that it does @strong{not} have to query the user
before doing dangerous operations, like overwriting files.  The global
variable @code{mbfl_option_INTERACTIVE} is set to @code{no}.

@item -i
@itemx --interactive
Signals to the script that it @strong{does} have to query the user
before doing dangerous operations, like overwriting files.  The global
variable @code{mbfl_option_INTERACTIVE} is set to @code{yes}.

@item --validate-programs
Validates the existence of all the programs needed by the script; then
exits.  The exit code is zero if all the programs were found, one
otherwise.

@item --list-exit-codes
Prints a list of numerical exit codes and their associated names, as
declared in the script.  @ref{main exit, Declaring exit codes}.

@item --print-exit-code=NAME
Prints the numerical exit code associated to @code{NAME}.

@item --print-exit-code-names=CODE
Prints the list of names associated to the numerical exit @code{CODE}.

@item --version
Prints to the standard output of the script the contents of the global
variable @code{mbfl_message_VERSION}, then exits with code zero.  The
variable makes use of the service variables.  @ref{service variables,
Required user defined variables}.

@item --version-only
Prints to the standard output of the script the contents of the global
variable @code{script_VERSION}, then exits with code zero.  @ref{service
variables, Required user defined variables}.

@item --license
Prints to the standard output of the script the contents of one of the
global variables @code{mbfl_message_LICENSE_*}, then exits with code
zero.  The variable makes use of the service variables.  @ref{service
variables, Required user defined variables}.

@item -h
@itemx --help
@itemx --usage
Prints to the standard output of the script: the contents of the global
variable @code{script_USAGE}; a newline; the string @code{options:}; a
newline; an automatically generated string describing the options
declared with @bfunc{mbfl_declare_option}; a string describing the
@mbfl{} default options; the contents of the global variable
@code{script_EXAMPLES}.  Then exits with code zero.  @ref{service
variables, Required user defined variables}.

@item -H
@itemx --brief-help
@itemx --brief-usage
Prints to the standard output of the script: the contents of the global
variable @code{script_USAGE}; a newline; the string @code{options:}; a
newline; an automatically generated string describing the options
declared with @bfunc{mbfl_declare_option}.  Then exits with code zero.

The difference with @option{--help} is that predefined options and usage
examples are not displayed.

@item --print-options
Print all the long options with
@bfunc{mbfl_getopts_print_long_switches}, then exit the script with code
zero.

@item --print-action-arguments
Print all the action arguments with
@bfunc{mbfl_getopts_print_action_arguments}, then exit the script with
code zero.
@end table


The following functions may be used to set, unset and query the state of
the predefined options.


@defun mbfl_option_encoded_args
@defunx mbfl_set_option_encoded_args
@defunx mbfl_unset_option_encoded_args
Query/set/unset the encoded arguments option.

@bfunc{mbfl_option_encoded_args} returns true if the option
@option{--encoded-args} was used on the command line.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_option_verbose
@defunx mbfl_set_option_verbose
@defunx mbfl_unset_option_verbose
Query/set/unset the verbose messages option.

@bfunc{mbfl_option_verbose} returns true if the option
@option{--verbose} was used on the command line after all the
occurrences of @option{--silent}; it returns false if the option
@option{--silent} was used on the command line after all the occurrences
of @option{--verbose}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_option_verbose_program
@defunx mbfl_set_option_verbose_program
@defunx mbfl_unset_option_verbose_program
Query/set/unset verbose execution for external programs.

This option, of course, is supported only for programs that are known by
@mbfl{} (like @command{rm}): if a program is executed with
@bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}, it is responsibility of the caller to use
the option.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_option_show_program
@defunx mbfl_set_option_show_program
@defunx mbfl_unset_option_show_program

@bfunc{mbfl_option_interactive} returns true if the option
@option{--interactive} was used on the command line after all the
occurrences of @option{--force}; it returns false if the option
@option{--force} was used on the command line after all the occurrences
of @option{--interactive}.
@end defun


The following are special option functions.


@defun mbfl_option_test_save
Save the current state of the test option then invokes
@bfunc{mbfl_unset_option_test}.

@c page
@node getopts interface
@section Interface functions


Every declared option should have a long switch, the brief switch may be
omitted.


@defun mbfl_declare_option @var{keyword} @var{default} @var{brief} @var{long} @var{hasarg} @var{description}
Declare a new option.  Arguments description follows.

@table @var
@item keyword
A string identifying the option; internally it is used to build a
function name and a variable name.  It is safer to limit this string to
the letters in the ranges @code{a-z}, @code{A-Z} and underscores.

@item default
The default value for the option.  For an option with argument it can be
anything; for an option with no argument: it must be @code{yes} or
@code{no}.

@item brief
The brief option selector: a single character.  It is safer to choose a
single letter (lower or upper case) in the @acronym{ASCII} standard.

@item long
The long option selector: a string.  It is safer to choose a sequence of
letters in the @acronym{ASCII} standard, separated by underscores or
dashes.

@item hasarg
Either @code{witharg} or @code{noarg}: declares if the option requires
an argument or not.

@item description
A one--line string briefly describing the option.
@end table
@end defun


@defun mbfl_declare_action_argument @var{keyword} @var{string} @var{selected} @var{skipopts} @var{description}
Declare an action argument.  Arguments description follows.

@table @var
@item keyword
A string identifying the argument; internally it is used to build a
function name.  It must be a valid Bash function identifier.

@item string
The string that identifies the argument on the command line of the
string.  It has limitations in format:

@itemize
@item
Its first character must be a letter in the range @code{a-z} or
@code{A-Z}.

@item
All the characters but the first must be: letters in the range
@code{a-z} or @code{A-Z}; numbers in the range @code{0-9}; dash
characters @code{-}.
@end itemize

@item selected
A boolean value that can be @code{yes} or @code{no}.  If @code{yes} the
function associated to this action argument is selected by default as
main action of the script.  The function name is built by concatenating
@code{script_action_} with @var{keyword}.

@item skipopts
A boolean value that can be @code{yes} or @code{no}.  If @code{no}:
command line options are parsed as usual; if @code{yes} when this action
argument is found as first parameter to the script, the rest of the
arguments are not parsed, but copied as is to the @code{ARGV} and
@code{ARGC} variables.  This allows to hand options not recognised by
the script to some external program.

@item description
A one--line string briefly describing the argument.
@end table
@end defun


@defun mbfl_getopts_parse
Parse a set of command line options.  The options are handed to user
defined functions.  The global array @code{ARGV1} and the global
variable @code{ARGC1} are supposed to hold the command line arguments
and the number of command line arguments.  Non--option arguments are
left in the global array @code{ARGV}, the global variable @code{ARGC}
holds the number of elements in @code{ARGV}.

If an action argument is recognised as the first element in
@code{ARGV1}: it is processed but @strong{not} added to @code{ARGV} and
@strong{not} counted in @code{ARGC}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_getopts_islong @var{string}
@defunx mbfl_getopts_islong @var{string} @var{varname}
Verify if a string has the format of a long option without argument.
@var{string} is the string to validate.  The optional @var{varname} is
the name of a variable that this function will set to the option name
from @var{string}, without the leading dashes.

Return with code zero if the string is a long option without argument,
else returns with code one.

An option must be of the form @code{--option}, only characters in the
ranges @code{A-Z}, @code{a-z}, @code{0-9} and the characters @code{-}
and @code{_} are allowed in the option name.

Usage examples:

@example
mbfl_getopts_islong --option            @result{} 0
mbfl_getopts_islong --option=123        @result{} 1
mbfl_getopts_islong gasp                @result{} 1
@end example
@end defun


@defun mbfl_getopts_islong_with @var{string}
@defunx mbfl_getopts_islong_with @var{string} @var{optname} @var{varname}
Verify if a string has the format of a long option with argument.
Arguments:

@table @var
@item string
The string to validate.

@item optname
Optional name of a variable that this function will set to the option
name from @var{string}, without the leading dashes.

@item varname
Optional name of a variable that this function will set to the option
value from @var{string}.
@end table

Return with code zero if the string is a long option with argument, else
return with code one.

An option must be of the form @code{--option=value}, only characters in
the ranges @code{A-Z}, @code{a-z}, @code{0-9} and the characters
@code{-} and @code{_} are allowed in the option name.

If the argument is not an option with value, the variable names are
ignored.

Usage examples:

@example
mbfl_getopts_islong_with --option=one   @result{} 0
mbfl_getopts_islong_with --option       @result{} 1
mbfl_getopts_islong_with wappa          @result{} 1

@section Testing a script and running programs


@mbfl{} allows a script to execute a ``dry run'', that is: do not
perform any operation on the system, just print messages describing what
will happen if the script is executed with the selected options.  This
implies, in the @mbfl{} model, that no external program is executed.

When this feature is turned on: @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec} does not
execute the program, instead it prints the command line on standard
error and it returns true.


@defun mbfl_set_option_test
Enable the script test option.  After this: a script must not mutate the
system in any way, it should just print messages describing the
operations.

However, the script is allowed to acquire informations from the system;
for example it can acquire the list of files in a directory or load the
contents of a file.

This function is invoked when the predefined option @option{--test} is
used on the command line.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_unset_option_test
Disable the script test option.  After this a script must perform normal
operations.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_option_test
Return true if test execution is enabled, else return false.
@end defun


@c page
@node program checking
@section Checking programs existence


The simpler way to test the availability of a program is to look for it
just before it is used.


@defun mbfl_program_find @var{program}
A wrapper for:

@example
type -ap @var{program}
@end example

@noindent
that looks for a program in the current search path.  It prints the full
pathname of the program found, or an empty string if nothing is found.

@var{program} may be a program name with no directory part (examples:
@command{sed}, @command{grep}), or an absolute or relative pathname
(examples: @file{/bin/sed}, @file{../bin/grep}).  If @var{program} is a
relative pathname and it is an executable file: the output of the
function is exactly @var{program}, it is @strong{not} normalised.

If an alias exists for a program, @code{type -p @var{program}} will
return the empty string; that is why we have to use @code{type -ap
@var{program}}, which will return the correct file pathname.

If the environment variable @env{PATH} holds the same directory more
than once, or there exist programs with the same name in more than one
@env{PATH} elements: @code{type -ap $program} will return more than one
line of output, one for each executable file found.  The first value
(the first line) is the one selected by this function.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_check @var{program} ?@var{program} ...?
@strong{The use of this function is deprecated.}

Check the availability of programs.  All the pathnames on the command
line are checked: if one is not executable an error message is printed
on stderr.  Return false if a program cannot be found, true otherwise.
@end defun

@c page
@node program executing
@section Executing a program


This module provides an @api{} to execute a program under the privileges
of the current user or under a more or less privileged user; it makes
use of @command{sudo}, to allow one to execute a program as a different
user (optionally without entering a password): refer to the
@command{sudo} documentation for the required configuration.

The functions described here must be used in the following way:

@itemize
@item
To execute a program under the current user privileges:

@example
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin
@end example

@item
To execute a program under a more or less privileged user:

@example
# At the beginning of the script:
mbfl_program_enable_sudo

# When executing a program:
mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user root
mbfl_program_exec ls /root
@end example
@end itemize

Every time we execute a program with @command{sudo}: we have to select
the user under which to execute it; if we do not do it: the internally
registered user defaults to @code{nosudo}, which tells the function not
to use @command{sudo}.  So the following script works as commented:

@example
mbfl_program_enable_sudo

# This is executed with the privileges of the user that
# launched the script.
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin

mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user root
# This is executed with root privileges.
mbfl_program_exec ls /root

# This is executed with the privileges of the user that
# launched the script.
mbfl_program_exec ls /bin
@end example


@defun mbfl_program_exec @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_exec @var{program} @var{arg} ...
Evaluate a command line.  @var{program} identifies an executable file:
it can be the program name, or a relative or absolute pathname.  The
optional @var{arg} values are command line arguments that are handed to
the program unchanged.

If usage of @command{sudo} was requested, the command is executed with
it; then the @command{sudo} request is reset.  This means that this
function ``consumes'' a @command{sudo} request.

See below for the redirection of the standard error channel.

If the function @bfunc{mbfl_option_test} returns true: instead of
evaluation, the command line is sent to stderr.

If the function @bfunc{mbfl_option_show_program} returns true: the
command line is sent to stderr, then it is executed.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_execbg @var{inchan} @var{ouchan} @var{program}
@defunx mbfl_program_execbg @var{inchan} @var{ouchan} @var{program} @var{arg} ...
Does all the same things of @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}, running the given
command line as:

@example
@var{program} @var{arg} ... <@var{inchan} >@var{ouchan} &
@end example

@noindent
additionally: set the global variable @code{mbfl_program_BGPID} to the
process id of the background process; that is: @code{mbfl_program_BGPID}
is the value of @code{$!} right after the process execution.

Using this function is different from calling:

@example
mbfl_program_exec ls <@var{inchan} >@var{ouchan} &
@end example

@noindent
because doing so puts in the background the function call (in a subshell)
and then runs the program.
@end defun


@defvar mbfl_program_BGPID
Used by @bfunc{mbfl_program_execbg} to store the process id of the
program executed in background.
@end defvar


@defun mbfl_program_enable_sudo
Declare the intention to use @command{sudo} and other commands required
to use it.  @ref{program declaring, Declaring the intention to use a
program}.

The declared programs are: @command{sudo}, @command{whoami}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_declare_sudo_user @var{user}
Register @var{user} as the user under which to execute the next program
through @command{sudo}; the user will be selected using the @code{-u}
option of @command{sudo}.  The value @code{nosudo} means: do not use
@command{sudo}.

When the time comes: if the selected user name equals the value printed
by @command{whoami}, @command{sudo} is not used.
@c When the time comes: if the selected user name equals the value of the
@c environment variable @code{USER}: @command{sudo} is not used.
@end defun

@defun mbfl_program_reset_sudo_user
Reset the previously requested @command{sudo} user to a value that will
cause @command{sudo} not to be used in the next program invocation.
This is useful to abort a user request.
@end defun

@defun mbfl_program_sudo_user
Print the current @command{sudo} user.
@end defun

@defun mbfl_program_requested_sudo
Return true if the usage of @command{sudo} has been requested for the
next command execution.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Executing a subshell


@defun mbfl_program_bash @var{arg} @dots{}
Execute @command{bash} with the @var{arg} arguments appended.  The
@command{bash} pathname is registered in the library at start up, from
the built in variable @code{BASH}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_bash_command @var{command}
Execute @var{command} in a @command{bash} subprocess, using the
@code{-c} switch.  The @command{bash} pathname is registered in the
library at start up, from the built in variable @code{BASH}.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Redirecting the standard error channel

There are programs that output useful informations on their stderr
channel (example: the @command{at} command).


@defun mbfl_program_redirect_stderr_to_stdout
Just for the next invocation to @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec} redirect
stderr to stdout, that is: use the @code{2>&1} redirection for the
executed program.
@end defun


This is useful because redirecting the output of
@bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}:

@example
echo ls | \
    mbfl_program_exec at 'now +25 minutes' 2>&1 | \
    while read
@end example

@noindent
redirects also the ``show program'' output (@ref{getopts options} for
the @option{--show-program} option explanation and see the above
description of @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}).  Instead By using:

@example
mbfl_program_redirect_stderr_to_stdout
echo ls | \
    mbfl_program_exec at 'now +25 minutes' | \
    while read
@end example

@noindent
the ``show program'' output goes to stderr and the stderr output of the
@command{at} command is, internally, redirected to the stdout of
@bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}.

@c page
@node program declaring
@section Declaring the intention to use a program


To make a script model simpler, we assume that the unavailability of a
program at the time of its execution is a fatal error.  So if we need to
execute a program and the executable is not there, the script must be
aborted on the spot.

Functions are available to test the availability of a program, so we can
try to locate an alternative or terminate the process under the script
control.  On a system where executables may vanish from one moment to
another, no matter how we test a program's existence, there's always the
possibility that the program is not ``there'' when we invoke it.

If we just use @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec} to invoke an external
program, the function will try and fail if the executable is
unavailable: the return code will be false.

The vanishing of a program is a rare event: if it's there when we look
for it, probably it will be there also a few moments later when we
invoke it.  For this reason, @mbfl{} proposes a set of functions with
which we can declare the intention of a script to use a set of programs.

A command line option is predefined to let the user test the
availability of all the declared programs before invoking the script.
@ref{getopts options, Predefined options}.


@defun mbfl_declare_program @var{program}
Register @var{program} as the name of a program required by the script;
@bfunc{mbfl_program_find} is used to locate the program on the system.
@ref{program checking, Checking programs existence}.

If @var{program} is a file name with no directory part (examples:
@command{sed}, @command{grep}) the selected program is the full pathname
of the file in one of the directories of @env{PATH}.

If @var{program} is a relative pathname (examples: @file{../bin/sed},
@file{./grep}): the selected program is the full pathname of the file
normalised by this function with respect to the current working
directory (with a call to @bfunc{mbfl_file_normalise}).

The return value is always zero.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_validate_declared
Validate the existence of all the declared programs.  The return value
is zero if all the programs are found, one otherwise.

This function is invoked by @bfunc{mbfl_getopts_parse} when the
@option{--validate-programs} option is used on the command line.

It may be a good idea to invoke this function at the beginning of a
script, just before starting to do stuff, example:

@example
mbfl_program_validate_declared || \
   exit_because_program_not_found
@end example

If verbose messages are enabled: a brief summary is echoed to stderr;
from the command line the option @option{--verbose} must be used before
@option{--validate-programs}.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_program_found @var{program}
Print the pathname of the previously declared @var{program}.  Return
zero if the program was found, otherwise print an error message and exit
the current (sub)shell by invoking
@bfunc{exit_because_program_not_found}.

This function should be used to retrieve the pathname of the program to
be used as first argument to @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}:

@example
function program_wrapper () @{
    local ARGUMENT PROGNAME FLAGS

    ARGUMENT=$@{1:?"missing 'ARGUMENT'"@}
    shift
    PROGNAME=$(mbfl_program_found myprog) || \
        exit $?
    FLAGS

    mbfl_option_verbose_program && \
       FLAGS="$FLAGS --verbose"
    mbfl_program_exec "$PROGNAME" \
       $FLAGS "$ARGUMENT" "$@@"
@}
@end example

Remember that we cannot use:

@example
local PROGNAME=$(mbfl_program_found 'myprog') || \
    exit $?
@end example

@noindent
because @code{local} will return with code zero even if
@bfunc{mbfl_program_found} fails, so the error will not be reported.
@end defun


@defun exit_because_program_not_found
Terminate the script with exit code @code{99}.
@end defun

@section Scheduling jobs for later execution


This section documents the interface to the @command{atd} daemon; we may
want to read the @command{at}(1) manual page.  The @command{at} service
allows a user to schedule commands to be executed at a later time.

This interface is suitable for scripts that define a unique simple
policy to schedule commands; example: at each run they schedule a
command in a fixed queue, to be executed at a fixed time in the future.

This is good to implement the logic: if a condition does not happen
before time @code{T}, then execute command @command{C}.


@subsubheading Commands declaration


@defun mbfl_at_enable
Declare the intention to use the @command{at} interface.  @ref{program

The declared programs are: @command{at}, @command{atq}, @command{atrm}.
@end defun


@subsubheading Arguments validation


@defun mbfl_at_validate_queue_letter @var{letter}

false.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_at_validate_selected_queue
Return true if the currently selected queue identifier is valid, else
print an error message and return false.  A false return code means
that an internal error has corrupted the module state.
@end defun


@subsubheading Commands scheduling


@defun mbfl_at_select_queue @var{letter}
Select and register in an internal state a queue identifier; invoke
@bfunc{mbfl_at_validate_queue_letter} to validate the selection.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_at_schedule @var{command} @var{time}
Schedule @var{command} in the currently selected queue; the script will
be executed at @var{time}.

If no error occurs: print to stdout the identifier of the scheduled
job; the identifier can be used as argument to @bfunc{mbfl_at_drop}.

@quotation
The @command{at} command outputs some text (in which the job is
embedded) on its stderr channel, so this function redirects stderr to
stdout to return the value; this operation conflicts with the use of the
``show program'' feature of @bfunc{mbfl_program_exec}.
@end quotation

@var{command} must be a string representing the invocation of an
external executable program: it is sent unchanged to the @command{at}
command.  @var{time} is the argument to the @command{at} command, see the
manual page for its description.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_at_drop @var{identifier}
Remove a job; the identifier of a job is unique in all the queues, so
this function is not affected by the currently selected queue.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_at_queue_clean

stdout, that is: a newline is echoed to stdout.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_string_first @var{string} @var{char}
@defunx mbfl_string_first @var{string} @var{char} @var{begin}
Search characters in a string.  Arguments: @var{string}, the target
string; @var{char}, the character to look for; @var{begin}, optional,
the index of the character in the target string from which the search
begins (defaults to zero).

Print an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of
@var{char} in @var{string}.  If the character is not found: nothing is
sent to stdout.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_string_last @var{string} @var{char}
@defunx mbfl_string_last @var{string} @var{char} @var{begin}
Search characters in a string starting from the end.  Arguments:
@var{string}, the target string; @var{char}, the character to look for;
@var{begin}, optional, the index of the character in the target string
from which the search begins (defaults to zero).

Print an integer representing the index of the last occurrence of
@var{char} in @var{string}.  If the character is not found: nothing is
sent to stdout.
@end defun


@defun mbfl_string_range @var{string} @var{begin} @var{end}
Extract a range of characters from a string.  Arguments: @var{string},
the source string; @var{begin}, the index of the first character in the
range; @var{end}, optional, the index of the character next to the last
in the range, this character is not extracted.  @var{end} defaults to
the last character in the string; if equal to @code{end}: the end of the
range is the end of the string.  Echo to stdout the selected range of
characters.

@node string splitting
@section Splitting a string


@defun mbfl_string_chars @var{string}
Split a string into characters.  Fill an array named @code{SPLITFIELD}
with the characters from the string; the number of elements in the array
is stored in a variable named @code{SPLITCOUNT}.  Both @code{SPLITFIELD}
and @code{SPLITCOUNT} can be declared @code{local} in the scope of the
caller.

The difference between this function and using @code{$@{STRING:$i:1@}},
is that this function detects backslash characters, @code{\}, and treats
them as part of the following character.  So, for example, the sequence
@code{\n} is treated as a single char.
@end defun


Example of usage for @bfunc{mbfl_string_chars}:

@example
string="abcde\nfghilm"
mbfl_string_chars "$@{string@}"
# Now:
# "$@{#string@}" = $SPLITCOUNT
#  a = "$@{SPLITFIELD[0]@}"
#  b = "$@{SPLITFIELD[1]@}"
#  c = "$@{SPLITFIELD[2]@}"
#  d = "$@{SPLITFIELD[3]@}"
#  e = "$@{SPLITFIELD[4]@}"
#  \n = "$@{SPLITFIELD[5]@}"
#  f = "$@{SPLITFIELD[6]@}"
#  g = "$@{SPLITFIELD[7]@}"
#  h = "$@{SPLITFIELD[8]@}"
#  i = "$@{SPLITFIELD[9]@}"
#  l = "$@{SPLITFIELD[10]@}"
#  m = "$@{SPLITFIELD[11]@}"
@end example


@defun mbfl_string_split @var{string} @var{separator}
Split @var{string} into fields using @var{separator}.  Fill an array
named @code{SPLITFIELD} with the characters from the string; the number
of elements in the array is stored in a variable named
@code{SPLITCOUNT}.  Both @code{SPLITFIELD} and @code{SPLITCOUNT} can be
declared @code{local} in the scope of the caller.

@chapter Building test suites


@mbfl{} comes with a little library of functions that may be used to
build test suites; its aim is at building tests for Bash functions,
commands and scripts.

The ideas at the base of this library are taken from the @code{tcltest}
package distributed with the @acronym{TCL} core @footnote{@acronym{TCL}
stands for @emph{Tool Command Language} and it is a scripting language
originally written by John Ousterhout, see: @url{http://www.tcl.tk/}.};
this package had contributions from the following people/entities: Sun
Microsystems, Inc.; Scriptics Corporation; Ajuba Solutions; Don Porter,
@acronym{NIST}; probably many many others.

The library tries to do as much as possible using functions and aliases,
not variables; this is an attempt to let the user redefine functions to
his taste.

@c page
@node testing intro
@section A way to organise a test suite


A useful way to organise a test suite is to split it into a set of
files: one for each module to be tested.

The file @file{libmbfltest.sh} must be sourced at the beginning of each
test file.  This means that the variables that you set may interfere
with the ones in the library; this should not happen because the test
library prefixes variable names with @code{mbfl_} or @code{dotest_}, but
one exception is @env{TMPDIR}: do not set it in your script, use
@bfunc{dotest-echo-tmpdir} to access that value.  @ref{testing files,
Handling files in tests}.


@subsubheading A not so automated example

To understand how the library works lets examine a bare bones example.

The function @code{dotest} should be invoked at the end of each module
in the test suite; each module should define functions starting with the
same prefix.  A module should be stored in a file, and should look like
the following:

@example
# mymodule.test --

source libmbfltest.sh
source module.sh

function module-featureA-1.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureA-1.2 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureA-2.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureB-1.1 () @{ ... @}
function module-featureB-1.2 () @{ ... @}

dotest module-

### end of file
@end example

@noindent
the file should be executed with:

@example
$ bash mymodule.test
@end example

To test just "feature A":

@example
$ TESTMATCH=module-featureA bash mymodule.test
@end example

Remember that the @code{source} builtin will look for files in the
directories selected by the @env{PATH} environment variables, so we may
want to do:

@example
$ PATH=path/to/modules:$@{PATH@} \
TESTMATCH=module-featureA bash mymodule.test
@end example

It is better to put such stuff in a @file{Makefile}, with @gnu{} Make:

@example
srcdir        = ...
builddir      = ...
BASH_PROGRAM  = bash
MODULES       = moduleA moduleB

testdir       = $(srcdir)/tests
test_FILES    = $(foreach f,$(MODULES),$(testdir)/$(f).test)

test_ENV      = PATH=$(builddir):$(testdir):$(PATH) \
                TESTMATCH=$(TESTMATCH)
test_CMD      = $(test_ENV) $(BASH_PROGRAM)

.PHONY: test-modules

test-modules:
        @@$(foreach f,$(test_FILES),$(test_CMD) $(f);)
@end example

@c page
@node testing shell
@section A script to run tests


@mbfl{} comes with a script that can be used to handle the execution
of tests; it is called @command{mbfltest.sh}.  Synopsis:

@example
mbfltest.sh [options] TESTFILE ...
@end example

@noindent
supported options are all the @mbfl{} generic ones (@ref{getopts
options, Predefined options}) and additionally:

@table @code
@item --start
Print start messages for tests, it is the same as invoking
@bfunc{dotest-set-report-start}.

@item --end
Print end messages for tests, it is the same as invoking
@bfunc{dotest-set-report-success}.

@item --match=VALUE
Select match pattern for tests, it is the same as setting the
@env{TESTMATCH} variable.

@item --directory=VALUE
Change directory before executing tests, but after having located the
test files on the file system.

@item --library=VALUE
Select a specific version of the @mbfl{} library.
@end table

When running tests with the script: in the test modules we can omit the
sourcing of @mbfl{} and the @mbfl{} test library, @command{mbfltest.sh}
does this before sourcing the test module.  Each test module is evaluated
in a @bash{} subprocess, so: there is no interference between modules;
each module has to do its own initialisation and finalisation.

With @gnu{} Make we can do:

@example
MBFLTEST        = mbfltest.sh
MBFLTEST_FLAGS  = --end
ifneq (,$(TESTMATCH))
MBFLTEST_FLAGS  += --match=$(TESTMATCH)
endif

srcdir          = ...
testdir         = $(srcdir)/tests
TESTNAME        = *
TESTFILES       = $(wildcard $(testdir)/$(TESTNAME).test)

.PHONY: test tests

ifneq ($(strip $(TESTFILES)),)
test tests:
        $(MBFLTEST) $(MBFLTEST_FLAGS) $(TESTFILES)
endif

@section Running test functions


@defun dotest @var{pattern}
Run all the functions matching @var{pattern}.  Usually @var{pattern} is
the first part of the name of the functions to be executed; the function
names are selected with the following code:

@example
compgen -A function @var{pattern}
@end example

There's no constraint on function names, but they must be one--word
names.

Before running a test function: the current process working directory is
saved, and it is restored after the execution is terminated.

The return value of the test functions is used as result of the test:
true, the test succeeded; false, the test failed.  Remembering that the
return value of a function is the return value of its last executed
command, the functions @bfunc{dotest-equal} and @bfunc{dotest-output}, and
of course the @command{test} command, may be used to return the correct
value.
@end defun


Messages are printed before and after the execution of each function,
according to the mode selected with: @bfunc{dotest-set-report-success},
@bfunc{dotest-set-report-start}, @dots{}  @ref{testing config,
Configuring the package}

The following environment variables will influence the behaviour of
@bfunc{dotest}.


@defvar TESTMATCH
Override the @var{pattern} argument to @bfunc{dotest}.
@end defvar


@defvar TESTSTART
If @code{yes}: It is equivalent to invoking

@end defvar


@defvar TESTSUCCESS
If @code{yes}: It is equivalent to invoking

@section Handling files in tests


In this section are described functions to be used to create temporary
files; it is a common task to write scripts to manipulate files and
directories.  All the files should be created under a temporary
directory that must be removed after each test function is invoked; the
library automatically invokes @bfunc{dotest-clean-files} when exiting
(using @code{trap}), but it is safer to invoke it at the end of each
function that creates files.

@subsection Directories


@defun dotest-cd @var{directory}
Change the working directory.  This is just a wrapper for @command{cd};
if verbose mode is on: print a message.
@end defun


@defun dotest-mkdir @var{directory}
@defunx dotest-mkdir @var{directory} @var{prefix}
Create @var{directory} under the temporary directory; @var{directory}
must be a relative pathname (that is: it must not begin with a slash).

The optional @var{prefix} is a relative pathname that is prepended to
@var{directory}: it is useful to prepend the name of a parent directory.

Print to stdout the full pathname of the directory.

@subsubheading Temporary directory

@defun dotest-echo-tmpdir
Print the value of the temporary directory in which all the files and
directories will be created.  The value is prefixed with the value of
the environment variable @env{TMPDIR}, or @file{/tmp} if not set.
@end defun


@defun dotest-cd-tmpdir
Change the working directory to the temporary directory.
@end defun


@defun dotest-mktmpdir
Create the temporary directory.  This is automatically invoked by
@bfunc{dotest-mkfile} before creating files; @bfunc{dotest-mkdir}
creates the temporary directory automatically by using the
@option{--parents} option of @command{mkdir}.
@end defun

that is prepended to @var{pathname}: It is useful to prepend the name of
a parent directory.  Print to stdout the full pathname of the file.
@end defun


@defun dotest-clean-files
Remove the temporary directory and all its children.  Should be invoked
at the end of each function that creates temporary files or directories.

Return the value of the last command executed before the invocation,
that way it can be used right after @bfunc{dotest-output} and
@bfunc{dotest-equal} without loosing the return value of the function.

In this appendix we review some example scripts that can be used to send
email from a Bash script.  First we examine plain scripts (making no use
of @mbfl{}) to understand the basics of how to handle the @smtp{}
protocol and how to ``talk'' to a process in background; then we see the
documentation of a complex script.  All the scripts are in the @mbfl{}
distribution under the @file{examples} directory.

@appendixsec How to compose a test email message


Here we discuss how to programmatically compose a minimal email message
to be used in testing email scripts.  Basically a message should look
like this:

@example
Sender: marco@@localhost
From: marco@@localhost
To: root@@localhost
Subject: proof from sendmail-plain.sh
Message-ID: <15704-6692-23464@@this.hostname>
Date: Tue, 28 Apr 2009 06:16:01 +0200

This is a text proof from the sendmail-plain.sh script.
--
Marco
@end example

We have to remember that the @smtp{} server receiving the message may
rewrite the addresses, for example: replacing @code{localhost} with the
fully qualified local host name (the output of the command
@command{hostname --fqdn}); so, when reading the delivered message, we
do not have to be surprised to find changed addresses.

We want to notice the following:

@itemize
@item
The fully qualified local host name is useful to build header values.
We can acquire it with the @command{hostname} command like this:

@example
LOCAL_HOSTNAME=$(hostname --fqdn)
@end example

@noindent
do not confuse this value with the host name of the @smtp{} server!

@item
The value of the @code{Message-ID} header must be enclosed in angular
parentheses, and it must contain an address--like string with random
characters in the name part.  It can be generated with:

@example
MESSAGE_ID=$(printf '%d-%d-%d@@%s' \
    $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME")
@end example

@noindent
or with:

@example
MESSAGE_ID=$(printf '%s@@%s'                    \
    $(@{ IFS= read -n 15 line </dev/random      \
         echo "$line" ; @} |                    \
         md5sum --binary | cut -f1 -d' ')      \
    "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME")
@end example

@item
The value of the @code{Date} header must be the current date in a
specified format.  We can generate it using the @gnu{} Date program like
this:

@example
DATE=$(date --rfc-2822) || exit 2
@end example

@item
In the body of the message: the string that separates the text from the
signature is the three characters string @code{-- } (dash, dash, white
space).  When composing the message we have to be careful to use
commands that @strong{do not} drop white spaces.
@end itemize

In the end, we can use the following chunk of code to compose an email
message:

@example
PROGNAME=$@{0##*/@}
FROM_ADDRESS=marco@@localhost
TO_ADDRESS=root@@localhost

function print_message () @{
    local LOCAL_HOSTNAME DATE MESSAGE_ID MESSAGE
    LOCAL_HOSTNAME=$(hostname --fqdn) || exit 2
    DATE=$(date --rfc-2822) || exit 2
    MESSAGE_ID=$(printf '%d-%d-%d@@%s' \
        $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM "$LOCAL_HOSTNAME")
    MESSAGE="Sender: $FROM_ADDRESS
From: $FROM_ADDRESS
To: $TO_ADDRESS
Subject: proof from $PROGNAME
Message-ID: <$MESSAGE_ID>
Date: $DATE

This is a text proof from the $PROGNAME script.
--\x20
Marco
"
    printf "$MESSAGE"
@}
@end example

@noindent
notice that to put the required single white space character in the
text/signature separator we use the escape sequence @code{\x20} (where
20 is the hexadecimal value of the white space character in the @ascii{}
encoding) and print the message with @code{printf}, which expands the
escape sequences.

When sending the message to the @smtp{} server we have to:

@itemize
@item
Be careful in not to wrongly modify it.

@item
Send it one line at a time, terminating each line with a carriage
return, line feed sequence (@code{\r\n}).
@end itemize

So we can use an equivalent of the following chunk of code, assuming
@code{3} is the file descriptor connected to the remote @smtp{} server:

@example
print_message | while IFS= read line
do printf '%s\r\n' "$line" >&3
done
@end example

@noindent
notice that @code{read} is executed in an environment in which
@code{IFS} is set to the empty string, this is to prevent unwanted
modification of the message text.  @code{read} splits the string it
reads into words according to the current value of @code{IFS}, and this
may lead to mutation of the input string; word splitting happens when
there is a single output variable, too.  To prevent word splitting, we
set @code{IFS} to the empty string.

@appendixsec Just send an email message


The script below can be found in @file{examples/sendmail-plain.sh}.  It
just sends a hard--coded email message, from a hard--coded address to a
hard--coded address.  It makes no use of @mbfl{}.


@defun main
Drive the script controlling the @smtp{} protocol.  It should be obvious
what it does once we understand the following functions.
@end defun


@defun open_session @var{hostname}
Open a connection to the @smtp{} server using a fake device that Bash
gives us as interface to the network.  For the @code{localhost}, it ends
up being:

@example
/dev/tcp/localhost/25
@end example

@noindent
where 25 is the @tcp{} port which is officially assigned to the @smtp{}
service.  To open the connection we use the idiom:

@example
exec 3<>/dev/tcp/localhost/25
@end example

@noindent
which means: open a read and write connection to the selected hostname,
using file descriptor number 3.  There is nothing special in number 3,
it is just the first free file descriptor number after 0 (standard
input), 1 (standard output) and 2 (standard error).

The line:

@example
trap 'exec 3<&-' EXIT
@end example

@noindent
means: close file descriptor 3 whenever the script terminates.  This is
redundant in such a simple script, it is there for completeness.
@end defun


@defun send @var{string}
@defunx send @var{pattern} @var{arg} @dots{}
Send a string to the @smtp{} server.  Use @bfunc{printf} to format the
string @var{pattern} with the optional arguments, then write the
resulting string to file descriptor 3.  The string written out is
terminated with the sequence @code{\r\n} as mandated by the @smtp{}
protocol.
@end defun


@defun read_and_send_message
Read an email message from stdin line by line (newline terminator), and
rewrite it to file descriptor 3 terminating each line with the sequence
carriage return/line feed.  With the exception of the terminating
sequence, the lines are left unchanged.
@end defun


@defun recv @var{expected_code}
Read a line (a sequence of characters up until the first @code{\n}) from
file descriptor 3.  The line is interpreted as a message from the
@smtp{} server: the first three characters are a numeric code.  If the
code is different from @var{expected_code}, raise an error.

@node sendmail connector
@appendixsec Send email through a process in background


The script below can be found in @file{examples/sendmail-connector.sh}.
It just sends a hard--coded email message, from a hard--coded address to a
hard--coded address.  It makes no use of @mbfl{}.

@quotation
Bash version 4 introduced the new keyword @code{coproc}, which can be
used to spawn processes in background and talk to them via pipes.  This
keyword in @strong{not} used in this appendix.
@end quotation

The purpose of the script is to understand how to send a message through
a process in background.  It does the same things of the example
described in @ref{sendmail plain, Just send an email message}.  The main
difference is that the single function @bfunc{open_session} is replaced
by the two functions @bfunc{open_session} and @bfunc{connector}.

What is important to understand, is how @bfunc{open_session} runs
@bfunc{connector} in background and sets up two file descriptors to talk
to it.  In the real world we never use this technique with a function;
this example script makes use of @bfunc{connector} as a replacement for
an external program that can establish sophisticated connections to
remote hosts, for example using the @tls{}/@ssl{} protocols.


@defun open_session @var{hostname}
Open a connection to the @smtp{} server spawning a background process
represented by the @bfunc{connector} function.  It makes use of two
@fifo{}s (First In, First Out).

If we were to do it from a C language program: we would use the
@cfunc{pipe} system function to create two pipes connecting script's
process to the background process.

@example
 ---------  out pipe  -----------  socket  --------
| script  |--------->| connector |<======>| SMTP   |
| process |<---------| process   |        | server |
 ---------  in pipe   -----------          --------
@end example

Bash has no way to create a pipe using the @cfunc{pipe} system function
(up until version 4), so we use two @fifo{} channels created by the
@command{mkfifo} program:

@example
: $@{TMPDIR:=/tmp@}
local INFIFO=$@{TMPDIR@}/in.$$
local OUFIFO=$@{TMPDIR@}/out.$$

mkfifo --mode=0600 $INFIFO $OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the script will use @code{INFIFO} to read characters from
@bfunc{connector}, and @code{OUFIFO} to send characters to
@bfunc{connector}.

@example
 ---------  OUFIFO   -----------  socket  --------
| script  |-------->| connector |<======>| SMTP   |
| process |<--------| process   |        | server |
 ---------  INFIFO   -----------          --------
@end example

Once the @fifo{}s exist on the file system, we run @bfunc{connector} in
background, connecting its standard input and output to the @fifo{}s:

@example
connector $HOSTNAME $SMTP_PORT <$OUFIFO >$INFIFO &
@end example

@noindent
be careful in selecting the redirections.  Notice that, in this simple
example, we ignore errors running @bfunc{connector}.

Now we open file descriptors connecting them to the @fifo{}s:

@example
exec 3<>$INFIFO 4>$OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the script will use file descriptor 3 to read characters from
@bfunc{connector}, and file descriptor 4 to send characters to
@bfunc{connector}.  We open the input @fifo{} for both reading and
writing, else @code{exec} will block waiting for the first char.

We have connected both the ends of both the @fifo{}s, so we can remove
them from the file system:

@example
rm $INFIFO $OUFIFO
@end example

@noindent
the @fifo{}s will continue to exist in the OS kernel until the file
descriptors are closed.

Finally we register a clean up handler that closes the descriptors:

@example
trap 'exec 3<&- 4>&-' EXIT
@end example
@end defun


@defun connector @var{hostname}
Establish a connection to the @smtp{} server at @var{hostname}.  It is
not important here to fully understand how this function works; suffice
it to say that it reads lines from stdin, and echoes them to the server;
it reads lines from the server, and echoes them to stdout.
@end defun

@node sendmail gnutls
@appendixsec Using @command{gnutls-cli} as connector


@gnu{} @tls{} is a library implementing the @tls{} protocol; it can be
used to establish encrypted and authenticated connections to a remote
host.  The @smtp{} protocol has extensions to allow usage of a @tls{}
layer.

A @gnu{} @tls{} installation comes with a command line test program,
@command{gnutls-cli}, that can be used to establish an encrypted
connection by a shell script.  This command can be used as the
``connector'' modeled in @ref{sendmail connector, Send email through a
process in background}.  It has a manual page, which we may want to
read.

When handling an encrypted connection we have to know in advance how the
remote @smtp{} server behaves.  Let's see first the simpler example,
using the a human driven interactive session; then we will describe a
more complex interaction.

@quotation
Notice that @command{gnutls-cli} has a @option{--crlf} option that will
cause all the lines sent to the server to be terminated by a carriage
return/line feed sequence (@code{\r\n} or @code{\x0d\x0a}).  If we write
a script that terminates by itself the lines with this sequence, for
example:

@example
printf 'ehlo localhost.localdomain\r\n'
@end example

@noindent
we must @strong{avoid} this option, else @smtp{} protocol violation
errors may occur.  However, if we try a hand--driven interactive
session, we want to use this option to send protocol--compliant lines.

@appendixsubsec Immediate encrypted bridge


We use as example the server @code{relay.poste.it}, port @code{465}.
You have to have an account there to use it; do not bomb this server
with fake connections.  This server requests us to build the encrypted
bridge immediately after the connection has been established, without
waiting for any line of greetings from the server.

So, we start the connector like this:

@example
$ gnutls-cli --port 465 relay.poste.it
@end example

@noindent
if the connection succeeds: @command{gnutls-cli} prints a lot of message
lines on its standard output explaining what is going on; at last comes
the line of greetings from the server, which begins with code @code{220}.

The server supports the @code{AUTH LOGIN} authentication mechanism,
which requires the base64 encoding of the user name and password; we can
perform it with the external program @command{base64} (which comes with
@gnu{} Coreutils) like this:

@example
ENCODED_USERNAME=$(echo -n 'the-user-name' | base64)
ENCODED_PASSWORD=$(echo -n 'the-pass-word' | base64)
@end example

@noindent
@gnu{} Emacs users can do it with:

@example
(setq my-usr (base64-encode-string "the-user-name"))
(setq my-pwd (base64-encode-string "the-pass-word"))
@end example

@noindent
The authentication dialogue goes like this:

@enumerate
@item
We send @code{AUTH LOGIN}, to start the authentication.

@item
It replies with @code{334 VXNlcm5hbWU6} which is the request for the
username.  The string @code{VXNlcm5hbWU6} is the base64 encoding of the
string @code{Username:} (without trailing newline); we can verify this
with:

@example
$ echo -n Username: | base64
@end example

@noindent
or in the Emacs' scratch buffer:

@example
(base64-encode-string "Username:")
@end example

@item
We send the login user name encoded in base64.

@item
It checks the string and, if the format is correct, it replies with
@code{334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6} (this should happen even if the username is
unknown to the server).  The string @code{UGFzc3dvcmQ6} is the base64
encoding of the string @code{Password:} (without ending newline); we can
verify this with:

@example
$ echo -n Password: | base64
@end example

@noindent
or in the Emacs' scratch buffer:

@example
(base64-encode-string "Password:")
@end example

@item
We send the login password encoded in base64.

@item
It checks it and, if correct, it replies with a line starting with code
@code{235}.
@end enumerate

@noindent
Beware that if we are not quick to send the encoded password after the
encoded user name, the server may reset the authentication process as if
we sent a wrong user name.


So we can do the @smtp{} dialogue reported below by hand (which is an
edited log of a session under Emacs' eshell); lines starting with
@code{recv>} are the ones received from the server, lines starting with
@code{send>} are the ones we send to the server, the ellipses @code{...}
are replacements for server text we are not interested in.

@appendixsubsec Delayed encrypted bridge


We use as example the server @code{smtp.gmail.com}, port @code{587}.
You have to have an account there to use it; do not bomb this server
with fake connections.  This server requests us to start an @code{ESMTP}
dialogue, then issue the @code{STARTTLS} command and build the encrypted
bridge; once the bridge is set up, we restart an @code{ESMTP} dialogue
and do the authentication and the message delivery.

We start the connector like this:

@example
$ gnutls-cli --starttls --port 587 smtp.gmail.com
@end example

@noindent
if the connection succeeds: @command{gnutls-cli} prints message lines on
its standard output explaining what is going on; at last comes the line
of greetings from the server, which begins with code @code{220}.

The @option{--starttls} option tells @command{gnutls-cli} @strong{not}
to build the encrypted bridge immediately; rather, it waits for a
@code{SIGALRM} signal, which we must deliver to it when we are ready.
The quickest way to send such a signal, when there is only one
@command{gnutls-cli} process running, is:

@example
$ kill -SIGALRM $(/sbin/pidof gnutls-cli)
@end example

@noindent
beware that @command{pidof} may be installed in other places on your
system.

The server supports the @code{AUTH PLAIN} authentication mechanism,
which requires the base64 encoding of the user name and password stored
in a special record; we can do it with the external program
@command{base64} (which comes with @gnu{} Coreutils) like this:

@example
SECRETS=$(printf "\x00$@{LOGIN_NAME@}\x00$@{PASSWORD@}" | base64)
@end example

@noindent
@gnu{} Emacs users can do it with:

@example
(setq my-auth (base64-encode-string
   (format "%c%s%c%s" 0 "the-user-name" 0 "the-pass-word")))
@end example

@noindent
The authentication dialogue goes like this:

@enumerate
@item
We send @code{AUTH PLAIN} followed by the encoded credentials.

@item
It checks the user name and password and, if correct, it replies with
code @code{235}.
@end enumerate

So, we can do the @smtp{} dialogue reported below by hand (which is an

@appendixsec Using @command{openssl} as connector


OpenSSL is a library implementing the @ssl{}/@tls{} protocol; it can be
used to establish encrypted and authenticated connections to a remote
host.

An OpenSSL installation comes with a command line test program,
@command{openssl}, that can be used to establish an encrypted connection
by a shell script.  This command can be used as the ``connector''
modeled in @ref{sendmail connector, Send email through a process in
background}.  It has a manual page, which we may want to read.

Here we see how we can use the @command{openssl} program in place of the
@command{gnutls-cli} program described in @ref{sendmail gnutls, Using
@command{gnutls-cli} as connector}.  The two methods have a lot in
common (the @smtp{} protocol is the same), we only have to understand
the command line of the program.

@quotation
Notice that @command{openssl} has a @option{-crlf} option that will
cause all the lines sent to the server to be terminated by a carriage
return/line feed sequence (@code{\r\n} or @code{\x0d\x0a}).  If we write
a script that terminates by itself the lines with this sequence, for
example:

@example
printf 'ehlo localhost.localdomain\r\n'
@end example

@noindent
we must @strong{avoid} this option, else @smtp{} protocol violation
errors may occur.  However, if we try a hand--driven interactive
session, we want to use this option to send protocol--compliant lines.
@end quotation

* sendmail openssl delay::      Delayed encrypted bridge.
@end menu

@c page
@node sendmail openssl now
@appendixsubsec Immediate encrypted bridge


To build the encrypted bridge right after the connection, without
exchanging greetings with the server, we do:

@example
$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect relay.poste.it:465
@end example

@noindent
then we start the @smtp{} dialogue as outlined in @ref{sendmail gnutls
now, Immediate encrypted bridge}.

@c page
@node sendmail openssl delay
@appendixsubsec Delayed encrypted bridge


To first exchange greetings, then send @code{STARTTLS} and finally build
the encrypted bridge, we do:

@example
$ openssl s_client -quiet -starttls smtp \
    -connect smtp.gmail.com:587
@end example

@noindent
then we start the @smtp{} dialogue as outlined in @ref{sendmail gnutls
now, Immediate encrypted bridge}.  @command{openssl} knows how to start
an @smtp{} dialogue, and it does it automatically.

@node sendmail script
@appendixsec Sending email


This section documents the example script
@file{examples/sendmail-mbfl.sh}, which makes use of @mbfl{} to send an
email message.  The script sends already composed messages using plain
or @tls{} sessions, and it can use both OpenSSL and @gnu{} @tls{}.

@end menu

@c page
@node sendmail script examples
@appendixsubsec Usage examples


Let's say we have a file named @file{message.mail} holding a fully
composed email message:

@example
Sender: marco@@localhost
From: marco@@localhost
To: root@@localhost
Subject: server on fire?

I noticed flames raising from the server room...
--
Marco
@end example

@noindent
basically, to send it with @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} we have to do:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --envelope-from=marco@@localhost  \
    --envelope-to=root@@localhost     \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

@noindent
by default the @smtp{} server name is set to @code{localhost} and the
@tcp{} port to @code{25}.  The default session is plain, without @tls{}.

Port number @code{25} is officially assigned to the @smtp{} protocol; if
the localhost uses a different @tcp{} port, we can select it with the
@option{--port} option:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --port=587         \
    --envelope-from=marco@@localhost   \
    --envelope-to=root@@localhost      \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

To send mail to a remote @smtp{} server, we select its hostname with the
@option{--host} option:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --host=smtp.gmail.com --port=587  \
    --envelope-from=marco@@gmail.com   \
    --envelope-to=marco@@spiffy.it     \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

Mail services may offer encrypted sessions to their @smtp{} servers.
Encryption with the @tls{} protocol is supported by
@command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} through external programs.  Whether a server
requires an encrypted session, can be specified using the
@option{--plain}, @option{--tls} or @option{--starttls} options.

To establish an encrypted session, the script needs to acquire the
credentials of the user.  These can be stored in a configuration file
named @file{~/.authinfo}, which looks like this:

@smallexample
machine smtp.gmail.com login marco@@gmail.com password abcdefghilm
machine relay.poste.it login marco@@poste.it  password 0123456789
@end smallexample

@noindent
so that a line/record can be uniquely identified with values of the
@option{--host} and @option{--username} options.

So we can do:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=gmail       \
    --username=marco --starttls        \
    --envelope-from=marco@@gmail.com   \
    --envelope-to=marco@@spiffy.it     \
    --message=message.mail
@end example

@c page
@node sendmail script invoking
@appendixsubsec Command line options


The synopsis is:

@smallexample
sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --envelope-from=@meta{ADDRESS}              \
    --envelope-to=@meta{ADDRESS}                \
    [--message=@meta{SOURCE} | --test-message]
    [options]
@end smallexample

@noindent
the script sends an email address, and it can do a plain session or use
a connector.  Options description follows.

@table @code
@item -F@var{address}
@itemx --envelope-from=@var{address}
Select the @code{MAIL FROM} envelope address.  If this option is used
multiple times: the last one wins.

@item -T@var{address}
@itemx --envelope-to=@var{address}
Select the @code{RCPT TO} envelope address.  This option can be used
multiple times: each @var{address} is appended to a list of recipients.

@item -M@var{source}
@itemx --message=@var{source}
Select the source of the whole email message.  If @var{source} is a file
pathname, that file is read and used as data; if @var{source} is
@code{-}, the message is read from the standard input channel.  It
defaults to @code{-}.

@item --test-message
Send a test message with a hard--coded body part.  This option
supersedes @option{--message}.

@item --host=@var{host}
Select the @smtp{} server host name.  It defaults to @code{localhost}.

@item --host-info=@var{file}
Select a file from which read host and port informations.

@item -p@var{port}
@itemx --port=@var{port}
Select the @smtp{} server @tcp{} port; this option supersedes
@option{--host-info}.  It defaults to @code{25}.

@item --plain
@itemx --tls
@itemx --starttls
Establish a plain session, @tls{} session with immediate bridge
construction or @tls{} session with bridge construction after
@code{STARTTLS} command.

@item --gnutls
Use @command{gnutls-cli} as connector for encrypted sessions.  This is
the default when @option{--starttls} or @option{--delayed-starttls} are
used.

@item --openssl
Use @command{gnutls-cli} as connector for encrypted sessions.

@item --auth-info=@var{file}
Select the file, in @code{netrc} format, from which read the
authorisation credentials.  Defaults to @file{~/.authinfo}.

@item --username=@var{user}
Specify a string used to select an account in the authorisation file.

@item --auth-none
@itemx --auth-plain
@itemx --auth-login
Perform no authorisation, the @code{AUTH PLAIN} authorisation or the
@code{AUTH LOGIN} authorisation.
@end table

@c page
@node sendmail script hostinfo
@appendixsubsec Reading host informations from file


For each @smtp{} server we need the following informations: the
hostname, the port number, the session type, the authorisation method.
There are two ways to specify these:

@itemize
@item
Use the command line options as in:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh \
    --host=smtp.gmail.org --port=587    \
    --tls --auth-login                  \
    ...
@end example

@item
Use the hostinfo file and the option @option{--host} to select a record
into it, as in:

@example
$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=smtp.gmail.org ...

$ sendmail-mbfl.sh --host=smtp.gmail.org \
    --host-info=~/.hostrc ...
@end example
@end itemize

@noindent
If @option{--host} is not used: the hostname defaults to
@code{localhost}.  If the selection of port, session type or
authorisation type is left unspecified: The script automatically looks
into the default hostinfo file.  Informations from command line options
supersede informations from the hostinfo file.

The default pathname for the hostinfo file is @file{$HOME/.hostinfo} and
can be overridden by the @option{--host-info} option.  The format of
this file is line oriented: Blank lines are ignored, lines starting with
a @code{#} character are comments, lines starting with @code{machine}
are host records.

Each record line must have the format:

@smallexample
machine <host> service <name> port <number> session <type> auth <type>
@end smallexample

@noindent
for example:

@smallexample
# ~/.hostinfo --
#

# SMTP servers
machine localhost service smtp port 25 session plain auth none
machine relay.poste.it service smtp port 465 session tls auth login
machine smtp.gmail.com service smtp port 587 session starttls auth plain

# POP3 servers
machine pop.tiscali.it service pop3 port 110 session plain auth userpass
machine relay.poste.it service pop3 port 995 session tls auth userpass
machine pop.googlemail.com service pop3 port 995  session tls auth userpass

### end of file
@end smallexample

@noindent
so that we can extract a record with the following script:

@example
file=~/.hostinfo
host=gmail
service=smtp

rex='^[ \t]*'
rex+='machine[ \t]\+.*%s.*[ \t]\+'
rex+='service[ \t]\+%s[ \t]\+'
rex+='port[ \t]\+[0-9]\+[ \t]\+'
rex+='session[ \t]\+\(plain\|tls\|starttls\)[ \t]\+'
rex+='auth[ \t]\+\(none\|plain\|login\)'
rex+='[ \t]*$'
rex=$(printf "$rex" $host $service)

set -- $(grep "$rex" "$file")
echo machine $2
echo service $4
echo port    $6
echo session $8
shift 9
echo auth    $1
@end example

@noindent
this is exactly what @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} does with the file.

Notice that when using the hostinfo file, the value of the
@option{--host} option can be a substring of the host name.

@c page
@node sendmail script authinfo
@appendixsubsec Reading authentication credentials from file


The only way the script has to acquire the user name and password to log
into the remote server, is by reading the authinfo file.  By default,
its pathname is @file{$HOME/.authinfo}, it can be overridden with the
@option{--auth-info} option.

Its format is a simplified version of the @code{netrc} file format:
blank lines are ignored, lines starting with a @code{#} character are
comments, lines starting with @code{machine} are host records.

Each record must have the format:

@example
machine <hostname> login <user-name> password <pass-word>
@end example

@noindent
for example:

@example
machine smtp.gmail.com login one@@gmail.com password abcdefghilm
machine relay.poste.it login two@@poste.it  password 0123456789
@end example

@noindent
so that we can extract a record with the following script:

@example
file=~/.authinfo
host=poste
username=marco

rex='^[ \t]*'
rex+='machine[ \t]\+.*%s.*[ \t]\+'
rex+='login[ \t]\+.*%s.*[ \t]\+'
rex+='password[ \t]\+.*'
rex+='[ \t]*$'
rex=$(printf "$rex" $host $username)

line=$(grep "$rex" $file)
set -- $line
echo machine  $2
echo username $4
echo password $6
@end example

@noindent
and this is exactly what @command{sendmail-mbfl.sh} does.

The host name and the user name are selected by the command line options
@option{--host} and @option{--username}.  Notice that the values for
these options can be substrings of the values in the authinfo file.
