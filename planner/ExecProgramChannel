mbfl_program_exec should output test messages to channel 12,
by default a duplicate of stderr (channel 2); this has to be
documented. 

A function  should activate the feature  of directing stderr
of the  program to stdout  upon execution, and  then restore
the duplication 12 -> 2. Something like:

  mbfl_program_request_stderr_to_stdout
  mbfl_program_exec $command ...
