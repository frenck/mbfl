* Notes

Review the  file name functions  to use the  shell parameter
expansions '%'  and '#';  because: (1) it  looks like  it is
impossible to create names  with quoted slashes; (2) does it
make sense to consider a dot in a file name quoted? A dot is
a dot, so it may always be seen as extension separator.
